# CSMON: Cloudcheap Status Monitor

`csmon` is a high-performance, ultra-lightweight Terminal UI (TUI) monitoring tool designed specifically for game servers and bare-metal nodes. 

Instead of relying on heavy web stacks (like Node.js, Python, or Web Panels) that consume precious resources, `csmon` is written entirely in **C++11**. It directly reads hardware statistics from the Linux Kernel (`/proc` and `/sys`), guaranteeing an almost **0% CPU footprint** and consuming **less than 1MB of RAM**.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Real-Time Terminal UI**: Features a clean, color-coded, auto-refreshing interface drawn using standard ANSI escape codes, removing the need for `ncurses` dependencies.
*   **CPU Usage & Load Average**: Parses `/proc/stat` and `/proc/loadavg` to calculate live active time versus idle time, crucial for identifying game server overselling and preventing lag.
*   **Thermal Sensors**: Reads CPU temperatures directly from `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*`.
*   **Power Consumption (Watts) ⚡**: Integrates deep hardware tracking by reading the `intel-rapl` interface (for Intel Xeon/Core) and `hwmon` energy inputs (for AMD Ryzen). It calculates power usage in real-time by interpreting microjoule differentials per second.
*   **RAM & Swap**: Parses `/proc/meminfo` to display available RAM and Swap depletion to proactively prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes.
*   **Disk & Inode Health**: Uses `<sys/statvfs.h>` to monitor disk space on the root partition (`/`) and tracks Inode exhaustion—a common fault in environments with millions of small log files.
*   **Network Intelligence**: Reads `/proc/net/dev` to calculate live inbound (RX) and outbound (TX) bandwidth in Mbps. More importantly, it highlights `Drop` and `Err` packets to help warn administrators of potential network disruption or volumetric DDoS attacks.

## 🛠️ Build & Installation

`csmon` is designed to be fully self-contained on any modern Linux system. 

### Prerequisites
*   A Linux environment (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.)
*   `g++` (GCC Compiler)
*   `make`

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** to your server:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:anlongawf/status.git csmon
   cd csmon
   ```

2. **Compile the program** using the included Makefile. The Makefile applies the `-O3` optimization flag to ensure maximum runtime speed:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Monitor**:
   ```bash
   ./csmon
   ```

*(Press `Ctrl+C` to cleanly exit the monitor).*

## 🧠 Under The Hood (Metrics Explained)

If you intend to modify `src/metrics.cpp`, here is how `csmon` retrieves data:

1. **Power (RAPL/hwmon)**: `getCPUEnergyUj()` loops through `/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj`. If unavailable, it falls back to `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/energy1_input` to support newer AMD architectures.
2. **CPU Percentage**: `getSysCPU()` calculates the derivative of CPU ticks (`user + nice + system + irq + softirq + steal`) between 1-second intervals.
3. **Network Drops**: `getPrimaryNet()` scans all interfaces, dynamically selects the interface with the highest traffic (ignoring `lo` loopback), and parses the `rx_drop` column to visualize networking health.
